# briefmjcity (saved workflow)

When MJ says **"briefmjcity"**, do this exactly:

1. Open Cohley briefs and select **6 new briefs** that are:
   - NOT pet briefs
   - NOT newborn/baby briefs
   - NOT TikTok-required briefs (until MJ says TikTok is connected)
2. Open each selected brief in a **separate browser tab**.
3. In **each tab**:
   - Click **Apply to Brief** to open the application form (this is prefill mode, not final submit)
   - Complete any gating questions/prompts (answer **Yes** where needed to access the form)
   - Fill all required application fields
   - Visit @openike and pick a **brief-matching** sample link for each tab (do not reuse random links)
   - Match link topic/style to brand brief (e.g., finance/education → talking/explainer clip; wellness/self-care → lifestyle/self-care clip; fashion/shoes → OOTD/style clip)
   - Avoid obvious mismatches (e.g., makeup-only clip for unrelated finance/health brief unless no better option exists)
   - Use approved IG sample link(s) from @openike in MJ-required format: `https://www.instagram.com/p/<POST_ID>/`
   - Always include `https://` and `www` in Instagram links
   - Fill **"Highlight work in your portfolio..."** with a tailored response per brand
   - Fill personal-detail prompts (skin type, concerns, routine, work background, etc.) with high-fit, brand-aligned responses that maximize acceptance chance and stay consistent with MJ-provided facts
   - For product sections, select the exact required quantity (e.g., "Select 1 of 3 products") before proceeding
   - For product selection text boxes, use `Yes` (never `N/A`) unless MJ gives a specific value
   - For shoe/fashion briefs requiring size, use shoe size `7.5`
4. **Do not click final "Apply to Brief" submit** until MJ explicitly says to submit.
5. Leave all 6 application tabs open for MJ review.
6. Send MJ a tracker email with all filled **Highlight** responses for record-keeping.
7. Wait for explicit go-ahead:
   - "submit all" or
   - specific tab/campaign IDs to submit.

## Corrections locked in
- Must use **separate tabs** (not sequential single-tab flow).
- Must ensure forms are actually filled in each tab before reporting done.
- Must pause for MJ review before any final submission.
