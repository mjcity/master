# briefmjcity (saved workflow)

When MJ says **"briefmjcity"**, do this exactly:

1. Open Cohley briefs and select **6 new briefs** that are:
   - NOT pet briefs
   - NOT newborn/baby briefs
2. Open each selected brief in a **separate browser tab**.
3. In **each tab**:
   - Click **Apply to Brief**
   - Complete any gating questions/prompts (answer **Yes** where needed to access the form)
   - Fill all required application fields
   - Use approved IG sample link(s) from @openike in MJ-required format: `https://www.instagram.com/p/<POST_ID>/`
   - Always include `https://` and `www` in Instagram links
   - Fill **"Highlight work in your portfolio..."** with a tailored response per brand
   - Fill any extra brief-specific fields (e.g., skin type/routine/job context) from MJ instructions
   - For product sections, select the exact required quantity (e.g., "Select 1 of 3 products") before proceeding
   - For product selection text boxes, use `Yes` (never `N/A`) unless MJ gives a specific value
   - For shoe/fashion briefs requiring size, use shoe size `7.5`
4. **Do not submit** final applications.
5. Leave all 6 application tabs open for MJ review.
6. Send MJ a tracker email with all filled **Highlight** responses for record-keeping.
7. Wait for explicit go-ahead:
   - "submit all" or
   - specific tab/campaign IDs to submit.

## Corrections locked in
- Must use **separate tabs** (not sequential single-tab flow).
- Must ensure forms are actually filled in each tab before reporting done.
- Must pause for MJ review before any final submission.
