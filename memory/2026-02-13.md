- Verified live issue on `https://mjcity.github.io/ope/`: only hero section renders; rest of page missing on both web and mobile.
- Root cause identified from live source (`raw.githubusercontent.com/mjcity/ope/main/index.html`): deployed `index.html` is truncated and ends right after hero section.
- Local workspace file `/home/michael/.openclaw/workspace/influencer-wife-site/index.html` contains full intended content (cards, interactive calendar, media upload/camera-mic features, weekly plan, prompt, socials, JS logic).
- Browser control service had intermittent outage during fix attempts (`Can't reach the OpenClaw browser control service`), then recovered; isolated browser repro confirmed.
- Next required action: replace repo `mjcity/ope` `index.html` with the full local file and commit/publish; then re-verify live render in isolated browser.
- Created shorthand workflow keyword: `briefmjcity` = open 6 new non-pet/non-newborn briefs, prefill applications (answer gating prompts yes), use links from @openike, send MJ an email tracker containing each "Highlight work in your portfolio" response, and pause before final submission.
