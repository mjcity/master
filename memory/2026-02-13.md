- Verified live issue on `https://mjcity.github.io/ope/`: only hero section renders; rest of page missing on both web and mobile.
- Root cause identified from live source (`raw.githubusercontent.com/mjcity/ope/main/index.html`): deployed `index.html` is truncated and ends right after hero section.
- Local workspace file `/home/michael/.openclaw/workspace/influencer-wife-site/index.html` contains full intended content (cards, interactive calendar, media upload/camera-mic features, weekly plan, prompt, socials, JS logic).
- Browser control service had intermittent outage during fix attempts (`Can't reach the OpenClaw browser control service`), then recovered; isolated browser repro confirmed.
- Next required action: replace repo `mjcity/ope` `index.html` with the full local file and commit/publish; then re-verify live render in isolated browser.
- Created shorthand workflow keyword: `briefmjcity` = open 6 new non-pet/non-newborn briefs in separate tabs, prefill applications in each tab (answer gating prompts yes as needed), use links from @openike, send MJ an email tracker containing each "Highlight work in your portfolio" response, and pause before final submission/review.
- Correction reinforced by MJ: for `briefmjcity`, always leave all tabs open and wait for explicit go-ahead before submitting.
- Link format correction from MJ: Instagram sample links must use full `https://www.instagram.com/p/<POST_ID>/` format (not `http://instagram.com/...`). MJ manually corrected current tabs.
- briefmjcity update: shoe size for relevant briefs is `7.5`; product selection text boxes should use `Yes` instead of `N/A` unless MJ specifies otherwise.
- Product-selection correction: always choose the exact required number of products in the selector (e.g., "Select 1 of 3").
- briefmjcity correction: skip TikTok-required briefs until MJ confirms TikTok is connected; prefill all forms and wait for explicit submit go-ahead before final Apply.
- briefmjcity correction: for each brief, first review @openike and choose a topic-matched sample link (avoid mismatched links like makeup clip for unrelated brief).
- Fixed campaign 24210 incomplete application issue by filling missing fields: comfort level, platforms, editing comfort, filming environment, and rate response.
- Fixed campaign 24177 incomplete application issue by filling missing fields: skin type (normal to dry), current skin concern, skincare-related job question, AM/PM routine, and product detail text.
- Ran a fresh `briefmjcity` test batch (non-TikTok) and prefilled these 6 briefs for review without final submit: 24219 (Dr. Kellyann), 24217 (Batiste), 24156 (TRUBAR), 24151 (Arm & Hammer), 24124 (TheraBreath), 24111 (CordaRoys).
- Sent tracker email to `mjcity0076@gmail.com` for the fresh non-TikTok 6-brief run.
