## Durable notes
- MJ asked for help publishing wife’s website to GitHub (`mjcity/ope`). Local site content exists at `influencer-wife-site/index.html`. Terminal push failed due to missing GitHub auth in this runtime; advised finishing via GitHub web UI + Pages settings.
- For a Zoom facilitation activity, MJ wanted non-personal, very simple options. Recommended quick formats like “This or That: Work Edition,” emoji check-in, one-word forecast, and A/B/C priority poll.
- MJ asked about model/API usage. Clarified that assistant requires active model connection, and in-session status shows `oauth (openai-codex:default)`; `/status` is the quickest usage check inside OpenClaw.
- Browser relay troubleshooting: repeated `HTTP 404`/no attached tab issues until Brave relay was attached correctly. Eventually gained control of a YouTube tab, searched `mjcity`, opened and played “IN YOUR DM.”
- Website update was successfully pushed to GitHub in isolated browser mode via web upload/commit to `mjcity/ope` (`main`), with commit message: “Enhance site with camera/mic, uploads, and gradient icons” (hash prefix seen as `4f8eba8`).
- Follow-up browser task completed: opened YouTube and searched for `opesfamily` on request.
