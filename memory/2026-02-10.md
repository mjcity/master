## Website project for MJ's wife (influencer planner)
- Created a new site at `influencer-wife-site/index.html` focused on a low-budget beauty/fashion/wig content strategy.
- Site includes:
  - colorful one-page plan
  - 5-post weekly workflow
  - budget guidance ($60/month + return workflow)
  - reusable prompt for content ideation
- Added an interactive upgrade:
  - monthly calendar UI
  - per-day notes
  - checkboxes for posted / filmed / returned
  - daily spend tracking
  - monthly success dashboard (posts, filming days, budget used)
  - localStorage persistence in-browser
- Committed changes:
  - `6cde856` (initial site)
  - `4b23149` (interactive tracker + notes/calendar)

## Access/deployment guidance provided
- Gave local access instructions for opening the HTML file directly.
- Gave external access options: local HTTP server, Cloudflare tunnel/ngrok, GitHub Pages, Netlify.
- Clarified that this chat session cannot run privileged install actions (sudo/elevated unavailable).
- Provided CentOS-safe install fallback for `cloudflared` via RPM URL.

## OpenClaw terminal usage support
- Helped MJ with terminal chat entrypoint and clarified to use:
  - `openclaw gateway` (run gateway)
  - `openclaw tui` (interactive terminal chat UI)
- Helped troubleshoot missing terminal input box by switching to TUI flow.

## Brave Search setup
- Confirmed `web_search` initially failed due to invalid Brave token.
- Guided setup via `openclaw configure --section web` and gateway restart.
- Later verified search working in-session.

## Browser task outcome
- Used browser control to find Spotify artist result for "Mjcity":
  - `https://open.spotify.com/artist/4TbJfltoNbaKOASaR8rsYM`
